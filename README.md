# Bin Mate

Bin Mate is a multi-MCU (ESP32, RPi Pico, more soon) bin reminder tool. Initially for Ballarat in Victoria AU but hopefully rolling out to more cities soon. It is an open source software/hardware project connecting to local council APIs to remind you which bins to put out on which days.

The project can be as simple as buying an RPi Pico + a click-on e-Paper hat (see "/RPi Pico" folder), up to a fully-custom PCB you can self-solder (see "/ESP32 PCB" folder) or buy as a kit (Soonâ„¢) that runs for months on a coin cell battery and sticks to your fridge with a magnet.

## Raspberry Pi Pico W + Waveshare Pico e-Paper 2.13in Hat

This is the easiest way to get started with this project, using just an [RPi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) (WiFi model) and a [Waveshare Pico e-Paper 2.13in Hat](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-epaper-2.13.htm). 

- Install MicroPython onto the RPi Pico using Thonny (or your tool of choice)
- Create a file called "secrets.py" and put the following code into it:
```
ADDRESS = "123 Sturt Street Ballarat Central"
SSID = "WiFiSSID"
PASS = "Password!"
```
- Copy the code onto the Pico.
- 3D print the included case, or bonus brownie points if you design/make your own
- Plug it into any USB plug for power (or if you're RPi-savvy, wire up some batteries)
.. and you're up!

If you do create this project, please share it with me either via Mastadon (https://hackerspace.au/@sen) or post it in an [Issue here](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/Bin-Mate/issues).

## ESP32 + 2.9" e-Paper Module

For a version of the project that can run off a coin-cell battery for many months, we're developing a custom PCB with an ESP32 onboard utilising all the deep sleep trickery, along with a cheap 2.9" e-Paper module, to create a device that can stick to your fridge/etc and requires no wiring, soldering, or coding. It will throw up its own Wifi AP with a dashboard for configuration and customisation. PCB designs and code will all be open-sourced and added here soon.

## Notes

## #Creating New Graphics

- Images should be 250px wide by 128px high
- Use [this website](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/) to convert the images, and the below settings:
    - Section 1. Select your image(s)
    - Section 2. All settings in this section stay as default other than "Rotate Image 90 degrees"
    - Section 4. Code output format to "Raw Bytes", Draw Mode to "Horizontal - 1 bit per pixel"
    - Click "Generate Code"
    - Paste into the appropriate area in the project code
